# Algorithms

It's important to be comfortable with some common algorithms.

For example, knowing how to sort a collection, and the differences in
performance of various sorting algorithms, and the implications, will
help you become better at solving all sorts of engineering problems that
arise from them, and have to do with dealing with collections of items.

Similarly, for searching algorithms.
